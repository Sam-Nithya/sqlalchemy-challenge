Requirements:
Repository Creation:

 created a new repository called sqlalchemy-challenge — ✔️
Directory Structure:

created a folder for the challenge (SurfsUp) and placed the necessary files (Jupyter notebook, app.py) inside. — ✔️

Jupyter Notebook:
Followed the steps for climate data analysis in the notebook, including:
Connecting to the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy's create_engine().
Reflecting the database schema into classes with automap_base().
Creating queries for precipitation and station analysis, then processing the results with Pandas. — ✔️



Flask API:
set up Flask routes to:
/api/v1.0/precipitation for precipitation data.
/api/v1.0/stations for stations.
/api/v1.0/tobs for temperature observations.
/api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end> for dynamic date range queries. — ✔️

Data Analysis & Plotting:
performed precipitation and station analysis, plotted results, and printed summary statistics. — ✔️


Flask API Functions:
successfully implemented the correct routes that return JSON data for the required API endpoints:
/api/v1.0/precipitation (precipitation data for the last year)
/api/v1.0/stations (list of stations)
/api/v1.0/tobs (temperature observations for the most active station)
/api/v1.0/<start> and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end> (date-based range queries for temperature stats). — ✔️
Checck Images folder for output


Code Organization:
The code seems well-organized, following conventions for variable names, functions, and clear comments throughout. — ✔️


GitHub & Version Control:
committed your changes, added your files, and pushed them to GitHub repository. — ✔️

Conclusion
This project demonstrates using SQLAlchemy for database interaction, Flask for building APIs, and Pandas and Matplotlib for climate data analysis. It provides valuable insights into Honolulu's weather patterns and offers an easy-to-use API for accessing the data.
